Face Recognition Attendance System
===================

The implementation of a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python is a straightforward yet powerful approach to modern attendance management. Leveraging the 'haarcascade_frontalface' algorithm for face recognition, this system efficiently detects and recognizes faces in real-time. By utilizing this algorithm, the system identifies facial features and maps them against a pre-existing database, enabling accurate and automated attendance tracking. This technology not only simplifies the attendance process but also enhances security and minimizes errors that can occur with traditional methods. Through the integration of Python and the 'haarcascade_frontalface' algorithm, the Face Recognition Attendance System showcases the potential of technology to streamline administrative tasks and create more efficient workflows.

### Setup 

I have articulated the steps in text format here : 

- Install the dependencies following these steps : 

  - Star this repository (top right corner) 
  - <>Code > Download ZIP > Open cmd/terminal in that location
  - Create Virtual Environment : `virtualenv venv`
  - Start Virtual Environment : `./venv/Scripts/activate.ps1`
  - Reqiuired packages : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Run this command : `python gui.py`

\* The setup for different projects might not be the same. Please refer to the individual setup guides given for each project.
